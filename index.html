            I have always had a passion for software development. It is
            important to me that software useful, accessible and enjoyable to
            use. I have a background of over 20 years designing and developing
            software, and look forward to helping you with yours.

            As a Senior Developer at Clever First Aid, I had the privilege of
            working with some extremely talented people across a wide array of
            technologies. Our suite of hardware and software products exposed me
            to numerous exciting challenges.

            I was tasked with designing and building the Customer Web Portal
            from scratch. This included working with our designer and our
            Product Owner to build out designs and a roadmap. I was the
            technical lead on the front end architecture and leaded development
            for the project. We used React with TypeScript which would
            eventually lead architecture decisions for additional products.

          <p>
            Later, my role expanded to include mentoring for our graduate and
            junior developers. I really enjoyed helping them learn and grow with
            frequent one-on-ones, workshops and local or remote pair programming
            sessions. I encouraged them to give talks to the rest of the team on
            challenges they faced and things they learned.

            <p>
              As a side-project while working at Clever First Aid, the hardware
              team helped me expand my knowledge into entry-level hardware PCB
              design and embedded programming in C++. I really enjoyed the
              expansion into hardware as another point of user interaction. With
              this knowledge I converted our Foosball table into a smart
              Foosball table with goal and goal velocity detection, bump
              detection and a live-updating scoreboard and leader board
              touch-screen interface.

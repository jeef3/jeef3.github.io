        <h4 class="company">Clever First Aid</h4>
        <p class="employment-time">Aug 2020 – Nov 2024, 4yrs 3mos</p>

        <p class="responsibilities">
          <strong>Key responsibilities:</strong> UI/UX design and research,
          frontend technical lead and development, mentoring.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a Senior Developer at Clever First Aid, I had the privilege of
          working with some extremely talented people across a wide array of
          technologies. Our suite of hardware and software products exposed me
          to numerous exciting challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hardware team helped me expand my knowledge into entry-level
          hardware PCB design and embedded programming in C++. I really enjoyed
          the expansion into hardware as another point of user interaction. With
          this knowledge I converted our Foosball table into a smart Foosball
          table with goal and goal velocity detection, bump detection and a
          live-updating scoreboard and leaderboard.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was tasked with designing and building our customer web portal from
          scratch. This included working with our designer and our Product Owner
          to build out designs and a roadmap. I was the technical lead on the
          front end architecture and leaded development for the project. We used
          React with TypeScript which would eventually lead architecture
          decisions for additional products.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later, my role expanded to include mentoring for our graduate and
          junior developers. I’ve really enjoyed helping them learn and grow
          with frequent one-on-ones, workshops and local or remote pair
          programming sessions. I’ve encouraged them to give talks to the rest
          of the team on challenges they’ve faced and things they’ve learned.

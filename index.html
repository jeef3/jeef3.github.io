            I have always had a passion for software development. It is
            important to me that software is useful, accessible and enjoyable to
            use. I have a background of over 20 years designing and developing
            software, and look forward to helping you with yours.

          <p>
            I was brought in to Shuttlerock as a Technical and Team Lead for one
            of the development teams. In my short time here I have helped bring
            the fully remote team of four developers together to collaborate in
            a more delivery focused way.
          </p>
          <p>
            I work closely with the Product Manager to plan future work for the
            development team, and with the wider technical heads to ensure
            consistency in our architecture.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am also still hands as a developer and work closely with the other
            developers, often in a pair programming manner.

            As a Senior Developer at Clever First Aid, I had the privilege of
            working with some extremely talented people across a wide array of
            technologies. Our suite of hardware and software products exposed me
            to numerous exciting challenges.

          <p>
            I was tasked with designing and building the Customer Web Portal
            from scratch. This included working with our designer and our
            Product Owner to build out designs and a roadmap. I was the
            technical lead on the front end architecture and leaded development
            for the project. We used React with TypeScript which would
            eventually lead architecture decisions for additional products.
          </p>

          <p>
            Later, my role expanded to include mentoring for our graduate and
            junior developers. I really enjoyed helping them learn and grow with
            frequent one-on-ones, workshops and local or remote pair programming
            sessions. I encouraged them to give talks to the rest of the team on
            challenges they faced and things they learned.
          </p>

          <p>
            Additional work included: Building our Design System/icon suite,
            complete with an export script for our icons to help keep icons
            built in Figma in sync with web and mobile products. Starting a
            shared monorepo SDK with a generated API built from the back end
            team’s Swagger document, complete with TypeScript typings.

          <p>
            At the start of 2020 the role of Product Owner was added to my list
            as we began development on a new version of our largest product. My
            dual-role involved feature selection, scope and design as well as
            laying out a roadmap for development to meet user and business goals
            using Aha!. I worked closely with the CEO, Product Director,
            technical leads and UX team to ensure we collected everything we
            needed to build a complete and well integrated product.

            After many contributions to front end development I was offered the
            role of UX Lead at Skilitics. I now lead our UX team where I also
            have management responsibilities. I work closely with our CEO and
            Product Director to guide the product strategy and find solutions
            for our products that benefit the users and the business. I still
            play an advisory role in front end architecture.

          <p>
            Working at Skilitics as a full stack developer, I played a key part
            in the front end architecture. I initiated UI testing, architected
            and designed our internal UI libraries and frameworks and planned
            the transition of our large Flex application to an HTML/JavaScript
            based solution, deployed to AWS.
          </p>

          <p>
            I took on further responsibilities such as Scrum Master and
            encouraged Agile development. I introduced Trello and Slack to aid
            team communications with our distributed team members. I mentored
            fellow developers through workshops and presentations and wrote
            helper scripts to provide integrations between Slack and our CI
            tools and later introduced chat-room deployments.
          </p>

          <p>
            I also lead the design, development and deployment of one of our
            Mobile apps — Macca’s THRIVE, for McDonald’s New Zealand — across
            Android and iOS. This included building a product strategy for later
            integration with a web based version.

          <p>
            I worked on the Tradevine team (tradevine.co.nz) at Trade Me
            (trademe.co.nz). Tradevine is an auto-listing tool for Trade Me with
            back-office sales fulfilment. My role as a full stack developer
            included the graphical design and implementation of large parts of
            the user interface. I was also involved with the user experience
            design, working closely with the Business Analysts and Product
            Owner.
          </p>

          <p>
            I introduced Spine (similar to Backbone) and Jasmine to the project
            which transformed the JavaScript portion from "uses jQuery" into a
            much more maintainable, testable and robust solution. I designed and
            wrote the majority of the UI widgets and interactions including the
            design and implementation of a complex data-grid control that had
            both front end and back end implementations.
          </p>

          <p>
            I designed and built earlier iterations of the Tradevine company
            website and the current Tradevine logo.

        <p>
          I started at Cavotec as a 3D modeller and animator, in charge of
          creating animations for their MoorMaster product line. As it was a
          small company I also became the IT/Network Administrator and the
          in-house software developer.
        </p>

        <p>
          I wrote several internal applications, but most notably a sales
          tracking web-application written in PHP and later re-written in Java
          as a thin-client/server desktop application. Also written in Java, a
          data-logger and graphical log viewer for the MoorMaster which
          connected remotely to industrial hardware and was capable of
          processing several gigabytes of data at a time, used primarily for
          diagnostics.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the past I have contracted back to Cavotec MSL to write a custom
          document number generator and database, written in Ruby on Rails and
          Spine.

            As a side-project while working at Clever First Aid, the hardware
            team helped me expand my knowledge into entry-level hardware PCB
            design and embedded programming in C++. I really enjoyed the
            expansion into hardware as another point of user interaction. With
            this knowledge I converted our Foosball table into a smart Foosball
            table with goal and goal velocity detection, bump detection and a
            live-updating scoreboard and leader board touch-screen interface.
